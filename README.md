Malware Detection
**Malware Detection Project**

**Overview:**
Malware Detection is a Python project designed to detect and classify malware on a computer system using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes system data collected from the computer's processes to train a machine learning model capable of identifying potential threats.

**Features:**
- **Data Collection:** The project collects various system data attributes from running processes on the computer, including CPU usage, memory usage, priority levels, and more.
- **Machine Learning Model:** It employs a machine learning model trained on labeled malware and benign samples to classify unknown processes as either malware or benign.
- **Data Preprocessing:** The collected system data is preprocessed to extract relevant features and normalize them for input into the machine learning model.
- **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using various performance metrics to ensure its effectiveness in accurately detecting malware while minimizing false positives.
- **Real-time Detection:** The project offers real-time malware detection capabilities, continuously monitoring running processes on the system and classifying them on the fly.
- **Error Handling:** It includes robust error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and errors that may occur during data collection, preprocessing, model training, or prediction.

**Usage:**
1. **Data Collection:** Run the data collection script to gather system data from running processes on the computer.
2. **Model Training:** Train the machine learning model using the collected system data and labeled samples of malware and benign processes.
3. **Model Deployment:** Deploy the trained model to classify unknown processes on the system as either malware or benign.
4. **Real-time Detection:** Utilize the real-time detection capabilities of the project to monitor running processes and identify potential threats.

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.x
- psutil (for system monitoring)
- scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- numpy (for numerical operations)

**Installation:**
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip.
3. Run the project scripts to collect system data, train the model, and perform malware detection.
